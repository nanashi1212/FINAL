FINAL
=====
Final Exam:

Sorry it took me so long to get git setup, got a little confused when I couldnt use the command line.

Final intended-functionality:
-User types in their name to load all previous activity/friend entries & AJAX $http loads the data
-User types in their name, activity, and friends(optional), to create a new entry in their database
-Loaded/created Name, Activity, data would be displayed on the two (disabled) buttons
 and the dropdown menu would display a list of the activity's friends

Final Notes:
Although I didn't get all to far, there are some things I would like to point out:

-had the concept of mvc in mind, using seperate folders for each--however, there's was no
implementations of models in the 'models' folder--these functions were in '_all.php' for this project.

-I briefly added SQL query statements to show I had a good idea of where the project would
have gone given more time

-had included ng-bind and ng-model data attributes to aid in manipulating the view
